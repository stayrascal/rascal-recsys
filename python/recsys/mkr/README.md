MKR is a **M**ulti-task learning approach for **K**nowledge graph enhanced **R**ecommendation.
MKR consists of two parts: the recommender system (RS) module and the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) module. 
The two modules are bridged by *cross&compress* units, which can automatically learn high-order interactions of item and entity features and transfer knowledge between the two tasks.

### Running the code
- Movie
  ```
  $ python preprocess.py --dataset movie
  $ python main.py
  ```
- Book

    ```
  - open `main.py` file;
    
  - comment the code blocks of parameter settings for MovieLens-1M;
    
  - uncomment the code blocks of parameter settings for Book-Crossing;
    
  - ```
    $ python main.py
    ```
- Music
  - ```
    $ python preprocess.py --dataset music
    ```
  - open `main.py` file;
    
  - comment the code blocks of parameter settings for MovieLens-1M;
